# ask.opensource.construction â€“ "Blackboard"

This RFC outlines the ideas behind the opensource.construction communication efforts outlined in https://opensource-construction.github.io/initiative/#21-key-activities-in-2023204.

## Problem

The AEC industry is very prone to toil and re-work as knowledge usually resides in individuals, to a lesser degree organisations, but almost never cross-organisation - despite a high degree of professions collaborating on a single project. This leads to the [**learning problem**](https://opensource-construction.github.io/initiative#what-we-see-in-aeco).

Currently there is no low barrier entry space to ask simple questions and exchange ideas.

## Solution

We propose opensource.construction to host and manage a community around sharing knowledge, workflows, software and data in the AEC industry. This is comprised of

- **infrastructure**: providing a technical infrastrcuture capable of hosting a forum / ask like platform
- **moderation**: moderating that community with a best effort approach, inviting volunteers to be responsible for topics / sub-communities

ask.opensource.construction is meant to
- **foster** project independent collaboration through async exchange in an open forum
- **decrease** knowledge silos by enabling a public and easy to search and index database of answered questions
- **highlight** best practices through up-voting
- **incubate** and test ideas and projects around common industry pain points

## Proof of Concept

An easy to use, ideally open source forum-like platform.
